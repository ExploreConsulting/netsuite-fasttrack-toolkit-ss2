===============================================
This is all the goodness (and more) of NFT reimagined for SuiteScript 2.x


#Getting Started (development)

    npm install
    typings install


# TypeScript
This is written with TS and is most powerful when consumed by TS. However, it can be used by javascript
clients as well.

## NetSuite Modules Declarations
The NetSuite bult in modules are declared under the `N/` folder, to mimic how they
are referenced in the documentation/code.


# NSDAL
Define record types under the `DataAccess/` folder.
